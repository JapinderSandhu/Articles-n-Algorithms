  Description: A subset can be treated as a binary tree.. If we r moving left we means we include tht element else we exclude tht from the set.
               Alternatively we can think tht to find the sum of a subset we either include a term or exclude it. Left show tht we include the term and right we exclude tht.
               Complexity O(2^n)
